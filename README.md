### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I'm Bradwill Van Niekerk A front end development student, about to finish my course in December of 2023. I am hard working and looking forward to learn more when I start working.

I enjoy working on new projects that challenges me and I enjoy learning new ways to work through problems.

I am currently learning java-script and have learnt HTML and Css with my course and I am learning React on my own in my free time.

If I'm not busy with my course work or doing research I would be playing games which helps me unwind when feeling stressed or in the gym.
